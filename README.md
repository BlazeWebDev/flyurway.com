 My first private project, creating a mock airport flight booking sight. Languages are HTML, CSS and if i can, minimal JS. 
 7:31 PM: I'm building up the html,i'm giving each html element a class/classes for easy trackimg and styling. I'm kinda nervous when the time comes to do box styling...
6:22 PM: I'm really stressed out,but i've got a partial feeling of accomplishment. I still have a long way to go before i'm pro. Well, thanks to being pushed and motivated, i now remember that i'm gonna beome a great web developer
